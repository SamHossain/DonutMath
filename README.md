# Flying Donut
## Donut py
This was inspired by a blog post by <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net">Andy Sloan</a>. This is my own implementation of the flying donut in python and rendered by <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news">pygame</a>. 
## Donut Math
This is an accompanying ipynb that goes through the math of the implementation and translates the math to python piece-by-piece.
